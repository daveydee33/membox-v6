        Use this to save new words, phrases, snippets that you are learning.
        Save them and take notes in the text area. Save phrases that you want to
        remember to review or that you want to reference again later.

        Think of each item as a card that should just hold a snippet of
        information -- like a Post-It note, or a flash card. On one side of your
        card you could have a snippet tile, and the back side you could have the
        details.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Then you can use this app like a box full of your index card notes, with
        a quick way to organize, search, add, edit, delete, and categorize your
        snippet cards.
